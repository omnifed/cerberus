We are excited to announce the release of Cerberus v0.18! This release introduces a new set of PandaCSS config helpers that make it easier to customize your Cerberus project.

Our goal this year is to make it easier to install, use, and extend Cerberus. Today, we are taking a big step towards that goal with the introduction of PandaCSS config helpers.

### PandaCSS Config Helpers

PandaCSS is the foundation of Cerberus and our new config helpers will keep your config clean with the ultimate goal of understanding where Cerberus is contributing within your PandaCSS setup.

Let's see it in action:

```ts title="panda.config.ts"
import {
  createCerberusConfig,
  createCerberusPreset,
} from '@cerberus/panda-preset'

export default createCerberusConfig({
  presets: [createCerberusPreset()],

  include: ['./app/**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
  exclude: [],
})

```

#### `createCerberusConfig`

The `createCerberusConfig` function adds the recommended Cerberus settings and any additional settings you pass into it.

This function is designed to be used as the default export of your PandaCSS config file as it will ensure that all the necessary Cerberus settings are applied to your project while providing the strict type checking you expect from PandaCSS.

It takes the same Object as the PandaCSS `defineConfig` function.

#### `createCerberusPreset`

The `createCerberusPreset` function does the same except on the preset level. It will add all the necessary Cerberus theme setup to your PandaCSS configuration.

At the core level, the Cerberus preset is a collection of:

1. **Tokens** - The [primitive tokens](https://panda-css.com/docs/theming/tokens#token-types) that power the Cerberus design system.
2. **Semantic Tokens** - The [theme specific tokens](https://panda-css.com/docs/theming/tokens#semantic-tokens) that are used to create a consistent look and feel for your application.
3. **Recipes** - The [component recipes](https://panda-css.com/docs/concepts/recipes) that are used to create the Cerberus component library.
4. **Conditions** - The [conditional styles](https://panda-css.com/docs/concepts/conditional-styles) that are used to create responsive and adaptive designs.
5. **Utilities** - The [utility classes](https://panda-css.com/docs/customization/utilities) that are used to create custom css properties for your application.
6. **Patterns** - The [layout patterns](https://panda-css.com/docs/concepts/patterns) that are used to make building layouts easier.
7. **Themes** - The [multi-theme setup](https://panda-css.com/docs/guides/multiple-themes#multi-themes) that is used to manage multiple themes within Panda.

This will open up the door for more advanced use cases and customizations, while keeping the core Cerberus experience consistent and easy to use.

### Archiving the `@cerberus/styled-system` Package

With the introduction of the new PandaCSS config helpers, we no longer need to depend on an external package to manage Cerberus styles within your project.

Before, we needed it in order for our React library to be able to use the same styling system as the rest of your application. With the new setup, we utilize the local styles generated by PandaCSS within your project.

This means that your local `styled-system` directory is the single source of truth for all of your styles.

#### Migrating to the New Setup

1. **Step 1**: Update your PandaCSS config file to use the new `createCerberusConfig` and `createCerberusPreset` functions.
2. **Step 2**: Make sure your project has the [correct typescript settings applied](/preset#path-aliases)
3. **Step 3**: Remove the `@cerberus/styled-system` package from your project.
4. **Step 4**: Update your imports to use `styled-system` instead of `@cerberus/styled-system`.

Once you have applied these steps, the only Cerberus package you will need to use imports from is `@cerberus-design/react`.

Anything PandaCSS/Preset related should be imported from your local `styled-system`.

### Other Updates

Among the new config helpers, we have also made some other updates to the Cerberus project:

- **Fixed**: Added better typing for the `Show` component that is more consistent with the original SolidJS API
- **Fixed**: Corrected a bad DatePicker import for the `DatePickerHead` primitive
- **Fixed**: Added missing styles for the `Scrollable` pattern

### Upgrading

To upgrade to the latest version of Cerberus, [run the following command](/preset#tip-add-a-cerberus-script):

<BashTabs code="npm run up:cerberus" />

### What's Next?

We are continuously working on improving the Cerberus experience and we have some [exciting features and improvements planned for the future](https://docs.solidjs.com/).
