| Component | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Carousel  | The context provider for the Carousel parts |
| CarouselItem | The individual item within the Carousel |

## API

### Props

The `Carousel` component is an abstraction of the primitives and accepts the following props:

| Name     | Default | Description                            |
| -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------- |

The Carousel also accepts all the props of the [Root component](https://ark-ui.com/docs/components/carousel#api-reference).


### Parts

The `CarouselParts` API is an Object containing the full family of components.

<NoteAdmonition description="It is best to only use the CarouselParts if you are building a custom solution. Importing Object based components will ship every property it includes into your bundle, regardless if you use it or not." />

| Name     | Description                            |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Root     | The `Carousel` component which is the Provider for the family. |
| Item     | The `CarouselItem` component which represents an individual item within the carousel. |
