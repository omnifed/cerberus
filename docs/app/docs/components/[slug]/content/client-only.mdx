## Motivation

The `ClientOnly` component renders its children only on the client side. This is useful for components that need to
access the DOM or browser APIs that are not available on the server side.

## Examples

### Basic

```tsx
import { ClientOnly } from '@cerberus/react'

export const Basic = () => (
  <ClientOnly>
    <div>This content is only rendered on the client side.</div>
  </ClientOnly>
)

```

### With Fallback

```tsx
import { ClientOnly } from '@cerberus/react'

export const WithFallback = () => (
  <ClientOnly fallback={<div>Loading on the server...</div>}>
    <div>This content is only rendered on the client side.</div>
  </ClientOnly>
)

```
