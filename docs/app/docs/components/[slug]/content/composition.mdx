## Composition

## The `as` Prop

Used to change the underlying HTML element that a React component renders. It
provides a straightforward way to change the underlying element while retaining
the component's functionality.

```tsx
<Text as="h3">Hello, world!</Text>
```

<WarningAdmonition description={<>This is only available for the <code>Text</code> component which is a wrapper around our text-related patterns.</>} />

## The `asChild` Prop

Used to compose a component's functionality onto its child element. This
approach, inspired by
[Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/utilities/slot), offers
maximum flexibility.

```tsx
<Button asChild>
  <Link href="/some-page">Open</Link>
</Button>
```

In this example, the `asChild` prop allows the link to be used as the
button (e.g., a button-styled link).

## Best Practices

To avoid common pitfalls when using the `as` and `asChild` props, there are a
few best practices to consider:

- **Forward Refs:** Ensure that the underlying component forwards the ref passed
  to it properly.
- **Spread Props:** Ensure that the underlying component spreads the props
  passed to it.

### Advanced Usage Example

```tsx
const MyComponent = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  return <Box ref={ref} {...props} />
})

<Button asChild>
  <MyComponent> Click me </MyComponent>
</Button>
```
