## Examples

By default the child component starts out as hidden and remains hidden after the `present` state is toggled off. This is
useful for situations where the element needs to be hidden initially and continue to stay hidden after its presence is
no longer required.


```tsx
import { Presence } from '@cerberus/react'
import { useState } from 'react'

export const Basic = () => {
  const [present, setPresent] = useState(false)
  return (
    <>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => setPresent(!present)}>
        Toggle
      </button>
      <Presence present={present}>Hidden and Hidden</Presence>
    </>
  )
}

```


### Lazy Mount

To delay the mounting of a child component until the `present` prop is set to true, use the `lazyMount` prop:


```tsx
import { Presence } from '@cerberus/react'
import { useState } from 'react'

export const LazyMount = () => {
  const [present, setPresent] = useState(false)
  return (
    <>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => setPresent(!present)}>
        Toggle
      </button>
      <Presence present={present} lazyMount>
        Unmounted and Hidden
      </Presence>
    </>
  )
}

```

### Unmount on Exit

To remove the child component from the DOM when it's not present, use the `unmountOnExit` prop:


```tsx
import { Presence } from '@cerberus/react'
import { useState } from 'react'

export const UnmountOnExit = () => {
  const [present, setPresent] = useState(false)
  return (
    <>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => setPresent(!present)}>
        Toggle
      </button>
      <Presence present={present} unmountOnExit>
        Hidden and Unmounted on Exit
      </Presence>
    </>
  )
}

```


### Combining Lazy Mount and Unmount on Exit

Both `lazyMount` and `unmountOnExit` can be combined for a component to be mounted only when it's present and to be
unmounted when it's no longer present:

```tsx
import { Presence } from '@cerberus/react'
import { useState } from 'react'

export const LazyMountAndUnmountOnExit = () => {
  const [present, setPresent] = useState(false)
  return (
    <>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => setPresent(!present)}>
        Toggle
      </button>
      <Presence present={present} lazyMount unmountOnExit>
        Lazy Mount and Unmounted on Exit
      </Presence>
    </>
  )
}

```
