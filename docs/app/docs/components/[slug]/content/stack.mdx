```tsx
import { Stack } from "styled-system/jsx"
import { DecorativeBox } from "compositions/lib/decorative-box"

const Demo = () => {
  return (
    <Stack>
      <DecorativeBox h="20" />
      <DecorativeBox h="20" />
      <DecorativeBox h="20" />
    </Stack>
  )
}
```

## Usage

By default, Stack applies `flex-direction: column` and `gap: 8px` to its
children.

```tsx
import { HStack, Stack, VStack } from "styled-system/jsx";
```

```tsx
<Stack>
  <div />
  <div />
</Stack>
```

## Examples

### Horizontal

Use the `direction` prop to change the direction of the stack.

```tsx
import { Stack } from "styled-system/jsx";
import { DecorativeBox } from "compositions/lib/decorative-box";

const Demo = () => {
  return (
    <Stack direction="horizontal" gap="md">
      <DecorativeBox h="10" />
      <DecorativeBox h="10" />
      <DecorativeBox h="10" />
    </Stack>
  );
};
```

### HStack

Alternatively, you can use the `HStack` to create a horizontal stack and align
its children horizontally.

```tsx
import { HStack } from "styled-system/jsx";
import { DecorativeBox } from "compositions/lib/decorative-box";
const Demo = () => {
  return (
    <HStack gap="md">
      <DecorativeBox h="10" />
      <DecorativeBox h="10" />
      <DecorativeBox h="10" />
    </HStack>
  );
};
```

### VStack

Use the `VStack` to create a vertical stack and align its children vertically.

```tsx
import { VStack } from "styled-system/jsx";
import { DecorativeBox } from "compositions/lib/decorative-box";

const Demo = () => {
  return (
    <VStack gap="md">
      <DecorativeBox h="10" />
      <DecorativeBox h="10" />
      <DecorativeBox h="10" />
    </VStack>
  );
};
```
