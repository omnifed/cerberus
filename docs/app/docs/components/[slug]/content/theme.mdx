title: Theme
description: Used to force a part of the tree to a different mode or theme.
---

import CodePreview from '@/app/components/CodePreview'

{/* <ExampleTabs name="theme-basic" /> */}

## Usage

```tsx
import { Theme } from "@cerberus/react"
```

```tsx
<Theme mode="dark">
  This is dark mode
</Theme>
```

## Examples

### Nested

The theme can be nested to apply different appearances to different parts of the
tree. This is useful for applying a global appearance and then overriding some
parts of it.

> Good to know: We use native panda-css attributes to achieve this.

{/* <ExampleTabs name="theme-nested" /> */}

### Portalled

Use the `asChild` prop to force the appearance of portalled elements like the
popover and modal content.

{/* <ExampleTabs name="theme-with-portalled" /> */}

### Page Specific Color Mode

To lock a page to a specific color mode (light or dark), wrap the entire page
with the `Theme` component.

```tsx title="page.tsx"
import { Theme } from "@cerberus/react"

export default Page = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <Theme appearance="dark">{/* Rest of the page */}</Theme>
  )
}
```
