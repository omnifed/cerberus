## FAQ

### Why does the package path for react look weird?

The Cerberus packages are published under the `@cerberus-design` organization in NPM (due to the name `cerberus` being taken). However, in JSR, we use the `@cerberus` organization. We eventually plan on fully migrating to JSR when there is better support for the features we need.

The version paths are simply creating an alias to the `@cerberus-design` organization so that you can have consistent package naming across your project.

Everything should use the `@cerberus` organization in your code.

### Why do I need to have a specific `baseUrl` in our tsconfig.json?

In order for our React components to know where to find the styled-system APIs, it needs to know where to look. By setting the `baseUrl` to the root of your project, we can use the `styled-system` import path without needing to know the exact location of the file.
