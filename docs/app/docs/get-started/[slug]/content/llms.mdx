## What is LLMs.txt?

We support [LLMs.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) files for making the Cerberus UI documentation available to large language models
(LLMs). This feature helps AI tools better understand our component library, its APIs, and usage patterns.

## Available Routes

We provide one LLMs.txt route to help AI tools access our documentation:

- [llms.txt](https://cerberus.digitalu.design/llms.txt) - Contains a structured overview of all documentation pages.

## Usage with AI Tools

### Cursor

Use the `@Docs` feature in Cursor to include the LLMs.txt files in your project. This helps Cursor provide more accurate
code suggestions and documentation for Cerberus components.

### Windsurf

Reference the LLMs.txt files using `@` or in your `.windsurfrules` files to enhance Windsurf's understanding of Cerberus
components.

### Co-Pilot

Use the LLMs.txt files in GitHub Copilot to improve code suggestions and documentation for Cerberus components.
