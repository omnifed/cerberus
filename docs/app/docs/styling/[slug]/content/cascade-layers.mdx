  HTML element.

Cerberus relies on CSS cascade layers to provide a predictable, performant way
to override components. The layers are defined to match that of
[Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com).

## Layer Types

Cerberus supports these cascade layer types:

- `@layer reset`: Where the preflight or css resets styles are defined.

- `@layer base`: Where global styles are placed when defined in `globalCss`
  config property.

- `@layer recipes`: Where styles for recipes are placed when defined in
  `theme.recipes` or `theme.slotRecipes`

- `@layer tokens`: Where styles for design tokens are placed when defined in
  `theme.tokens` or `theme.semanticTokens`

- `@layer utilities`: Where styles for utilities are placed when defined in
  `theme.utilities`

## Layer Order

Cerberus recommends the following order for cascade layers:

```css
@layer reset, base, tokens, recipes, utilities;
```

This structure allows for smoother experience when combining Cerberus and Panda
CSS in the same project.
