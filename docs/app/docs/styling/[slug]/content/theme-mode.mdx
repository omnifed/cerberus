## Overview

Cerberus provides support for themes and color modes, allowing you to create visually appealing and accessible applications that adapt to user preferences.

## Themes

To use a theme, just add the `data-panda-theme` attribute to your root `html` tag.

```tsx
<html lang="en" data-panda-theme="cerberus">
  <body>{children}</body>
</html>
```

Cerberus comes with two built-in themes: `cerberus` and `acheron`. You can switch between these themes by changing the value of the `data-panda-theme` attribute.

## Color Modes

Cerberus supports two color modes: `light` and `dark`. You can set the default color mode by adding the `data-color-mode` attribute to your root `html` tag.

```tsx
<html lang="en" data-panda-theme="cerberus" data-color-mode="light">
  <body>{children}</body>
</html>
```

Color mode works the same way as themes. You can switch between light and dark modes by changing the value of the `data-color-mode` attribute.

## Nesting themes and color modes

You can also nest themes and color modes within your application using the [`Theme` component](/docs/components/theme). This is useful when you want to apply a different theme or color mode to a specific section of your app.

```tsx
<html lang="en" data-panda-theme="cerberus" data-color-mode="light">
  <body>
    <Text>This text is in the Cerberus theme and light mode</Text>

    <Theme theme="acheron" mode="dark">
      <Text>This text is in the Acheron theme and dark mode</Text>
    </Theme>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Custom Themes and Color Modes

You can create your own themes and modes by extending your `panda.config.ts` file. For more information, check out the [Multi-Theme Support](https://panda-css.com/docs/guides/multiple-themes) sections in the PandaCSS documentation.
