## Primitives

Cerberus provides a comprehensive set of **primitive colors** (`theme.tokens.colors`) that serve as the foundation for all semantic tokens. These are the raw color values that semantic tokens reference.

<PrimitiveColorGroup />

Primitive colors are organized by color families and include numerical scales (e.g., `neutral.0` to `neutral.100`) that provide fine-grained control over color variations. These colors form the building blocks that semantic tokens reference to create meaningful, contextual color usage.

**How Primitives Relate to Semantic Tokens:**
- Semantic tokens like `page.bg.initial` reference primitive colors using token syntax: `{colors.cerberus.neutral.5}`
- This creates a clear hierarchy: primitives → semantic tokens → component usage
- Customizing primitive colors automatically updates all semantic tokens that reference them

## Semantic Tokens

Cerberus provides a set of semantic colors that drive our themes.

### Page

Used for pages, layouts, and any other container that is relative to a page.

<PaletteGroup palette="page" />

### Action

The primary palette for actions, such as buttons, links, and other interactive elements.

<PaletteGroup palette="action" />

### Secondary Action

The secondary palette for actions, such as buttons, links, and other interactive elements.

<PaletteGroup palette="secondaryAction" />

### Info

Used for informational elements, such as badges, tags, and other non-interactive elements.

<PaletteGroup palette="info" />

### Success

Used for success states, such as success messages, notifications, and other positive feedback.

<PaletteGroup palette="success" />

### Warning

Used for warning states, such as warning messages, notifications, and other cautionary feedback.

<PaletteGroup palette="warning" />

### Danger

Used for danger states, such as error messages, notifications, and other negative feedback.

<PaletteGroup palette="danger" />

### Data-Visualization

Used for data visualization elements, such as charts, graphs, and other visual representations of data.

<PaletteGroup palette="dataViz" />

## Naming Convention

Cerberus uses a consistent naming convention for colors to ensure clarity and maintainability. Each color is named based on its purpose and context, making it easier to understand its intended use.

```bash
[palette?].[usage].[prominence?].[interaction?]
```

| Name        | Description                                                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Palette     | The category/context of where the color is used.               |
| Usage       | How the color is used within the context.                      |
| Prominence  | The hierarchy of the color used within the page context.       |
| Interaction | The element interaction type the color should be applied to.   |
