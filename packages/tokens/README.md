# Tokens

This is a data workspace for storing tokens used in the Cerberus platform which
are synced from Figma variables.

This workspace is only intended for internal use within the Cerberus platform.

## Themenig

Since themes are highly influenced by synced tokens, this workspace is also used
to store theme-related contracts and types.
